Create a triptych of minimalist vector illustrations depicting a desert landscape at different times of day. Each panel should feature simplified sand dunes and celestial bodies (crescent moon, stars, sun) using a gradient color palette of purples, pinks, and oranges. Apply flat design with smooth curves and soft color transitions. Emphasize atmospheric perspective and a limited color scheme for each time of day (night, dawn, and daylight). The style should be clean, scalable, and suitable for modern digital illustrations or UI design.
